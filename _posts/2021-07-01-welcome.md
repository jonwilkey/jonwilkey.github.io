I've created other static webpages using Hugo [here](https://github.com/jonwilkey/MySite) and hosted on AWS using CloudFront + S3 buckets: http://jonwilkey.com/. While the site looks nice and the [Academic Template](https://github.com/wowchemy/starter-hugo-academic) was very nice, it was difficult to upgrade so I'm giving Jekyll a try instead.

Big thanks to [mmistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes) for their [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll theme](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes). Some notes thus far:

* Documentation on fixing `No GitHub API authentication could be found` warning message didn't work, but according to https://github.com/github/pages-gem/issues/399 this is expected, so ignoring that
* The default body font size looks huge on my current screen (great on phone though). Reading and trying the following didn't help, so I'm accepting the large font size for now:
  * https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/issues/1352
  * https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/issues/1043
  * https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/stylesheets/
