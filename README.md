# GitHub Pages User Site

This repo is for my personal pages site on GitHub. I've created other static webpages using Hugo [here](https://github.com/jonwilkey/MySite) and hosted on AWS using CloudFront + S3 buckets: http://jonwilkey.com/. While the site looks nice and the [Academic Template](https://github.com/wowchemy/starter-hugo-academic) was very nice, it was difficult to upgrade so I'm giving Jekyll a try instead.

Big thanks to [mmistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes) for their [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll theme](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes).
